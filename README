Wordpress DokuWiki Markup Plugin

--------------------------------

After becoming a huge fan of the dokuwiki, I missed the markup
while posting in wordpress, so I decided to bring the ease and power
of the dokuwiki markup into the world of wordpress. 
DokuWiki Markup was born...

DokuWiki Markup is a WordPress plugin that makes use of the WordPress plugin API.
The API is a great feature from WP. It's really easy to develop something
once you get the hang of it.

How does it all work?

When you feel like using the dokiwiki markup just enclosure the text in some
wiki tags like this

<wiki>

=== This is an example of the dokuwiki ===

enjoy ;-)

</wiki>

You can write non-wiki code before and after the parser, but this will not
be parsed neither by the dokuwiki parser or wp's parser.

This plugin works for both posts and pages.
  
Enjoy!
